# sw_arch_mindmap

There is a lot of literature about software architecture available. As printed books as well as online documents focusing various topics. However, it looks different when it comes to the "big picture", ideally a one-pager that gives you an overall overview. I was looking for such a document to explain people what (embedded) software architecture is all about. Because I did not find anything suitable, I decided to create a mind map on my own. Well, the current result is an already very full page and far from being complete (it never will/can be), but maybe it is useful for anybody else nevertheless.

Two versions of this mind map were already published on Linked-In before I now decided to maintain future changes on github:

Four files are kept in this repo:
1. *.mm the actual mind map
2. *.svg the SVG export of the mind map
3. *.odt the OpenDocument file including the SVG and literature references.
4. *.pdf the resulting PDF generated from the odt file
